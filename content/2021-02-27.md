### Introduction
Wiki pages are formatted using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax).

### Create a wiki page
To create a new wiki page, create a Markdown file with the suffix `.md` 
in the `contents/` folder.
It may be easiest to copy an existing Markdown file such as this one.
Once created, your new wiki page will show up when the site is
automatically updated and deployed.

### Images
Images are stored in the `static` folder.
For example, the candle image shown on this page is stored in 
[static/candle.png](https://github.com/sc-voice/scv-static/blob/main/static/candle.png)
