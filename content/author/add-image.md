### Overview
Scv-Static is a Buddhist website framework based on 
[SuttaCentral](https://suttacentral.net) 
as well as
[Voice.suttacentral.net](https://voice.suttacentral.net).
The framework provides custom components for building 
Github static websites that display the Early Buddhist Texts (EBTs)
and translations stored on SuttaCentral.
Intended to support local Buddhist communities, Scv-Static
can be customized with local content seamlessly 
integrated with shared Dhamma content.

### Technology
Scv-Static is built along [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) principles.
It provides Vuetify/Vue web components that are compiled into a static 
website for best performance and scalability.
