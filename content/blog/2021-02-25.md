### Create a blog file
To create a new blog article, create a Markdown file in the `contents/articles` folder.
It may be easiest to copy an existing Markdown file such as this one.
Once created, your new blog article will show up when the site is
automatically deployed.

### Images
Images are stored in the `static` folder.
For example, the candle image shown on this page is stored in 
[static/candle.png](https://github.com/sc-voice/scv-static/blob/main/static/candle.png)
